# Speak the Web

A GreaseMonkey/TamperMonkey browser extension that allows any text to be spoken. Uses the cross-browser [SpeechSynthesis API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis).

## How to install

The extension isn't ready for end-users yet, but you can test the latest development build:

1. Make sure you have latest [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (Firefox) or [TamperMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) (Chrome) extension installed.
2. Open [this link](https://rawgit.com/rotemdan/speak-the-web/master/build/speak-the-web.user.js) and an installation message should appear.

## How to use

Whenever the cursor hovers an area of text that can be spoken, a small `â–¶` icon should appear right above the top right corner of that area. To stop the speech press the escape key.

## Future

Once this gets usable enough it would be published as an independent extension for Chrome and Firefox, Opera and possibly Edge (by then it would be probably moved to the [WebExtensions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions)).
